# Minesweeper Game
My stab at creating a minesweeper game in React. This game works very similar to the XP version that everyone knows and loves. Left-click to check if a mine is located in the selected square. Right-click to place a flag marking the cell as having a potential mine.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have yarn installed and then run the following:

```yarn start```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in order to play.
